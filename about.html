                   <div style="margin-left:80px ;margin-right:80px ;font-size: x-large;word-spacing:5px;"> <p> My name is Nitin Kumar, and I am currently in my final year pursuing a Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) degree at the prestigious Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIIT), Kota. I am excited to be here today to introduce myself and share my journey, experiences, and aspirations as I embark on the next chapter of my career.

                        Throughout my time at IIIT Kota, I have had the privilege of immersing myself in a rigorous and comprehensive curriculum that has not only equipped me with a strong foundation in Electronics and communication engineering but has also instilled in me a passion for innovation, problem-solving, and continuous learning.
                        
                        In addition to my academic pursuits, I have actively engaged in various extracurricular activities and projects that have allowed me to apply my knowledge in practical settings. I have been a part of [cultural and sports club] where I had the opportunity to collaborate with peers, develop leadership skills, and contribute to meaningful initiatives.</p>
